GS NPC Dialogue System

To test the project, open the scene: Scenes/Main, and then run it. Tested form factors are 9:21 (per the spec) and 3:4.

Optional:
Open the Scenes/Start.unity scene first. It includes another example of data-driven interaction by saving typed character names into JSON, then loading the Main scene (Scenes/Main).


For ease of use and best compatibility, I have also inclued a unity package containing the project. To use:
	- Open a New Project
	- Drag the GS_NPCAssessment_Unity.unitypackage file from your Finder into the Assets folder in Unity
	- Enjoy!
