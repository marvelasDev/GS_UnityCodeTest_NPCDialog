# gs-npc-dialogue-system
Gravy Stack NPC Dialogue System

To test the project, open the scene: Scenes/Main, and then run it. Tested form factors are 9:21 (per the spec) and 3:4.

For ease of use and best compatibility, I have also inclued a unity package containing the project. To use:
	- Open a New Project
	- Drag the GS_NPCAssessment_Unity.unitypackage file from your Finder into the Assets folder in Unity
	- Enjoy!
